# SQL-Sakila-Database-Activity
This is a project to demonstrate my SQL competency by using data from the Sakila sample database in MySQL Workbench.

# SQL Competency
## Here is what my projects will demonstrate:

* Queries and clauses such as inserting comments, INNER JOIN, LOWER, UPPER, Using aliases "AS" and much more

* More complex queries such as SUBSTR, SELECT INFO, CREATE VIEW

* Editing a table, creating a database
* Constraints (ex. PRIMARY, AND FOREIGN KEYS, CASE WHEN, CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
* More complex queries (ex. PIVOT, PARTITION BY, OVER)
